# Coursera_Capstone

This repository developed a solution to pick the most suitable location for a new fast-food restaurant. 
We obtained datasets from different resources. 
The city's region list was scraped from the Wikipedia Page and Geo-coordinates of regions were obtained with the Google Maps Geocoding API
We used Python package sci-kit learn while building K- means clustering model after selecting the most appropriate cluster number using SSE and elbow point method.
Based on the clustering results, we made recommendations regarding the best region for a new fast-food restaurant in Berlin.
